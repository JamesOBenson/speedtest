# speedtest

Usage:
pip install speedtest-cli
python internet.py

This will create 2 files:
- ping.log
- speedtest.log

These files will be date/time stamped. The ping will report "Network Active" or "Network Error". While the Speedtest will report the "Server ID,Sponsor,Server Name,Timestamp,Distance,Ping,Download,Upload".

Designed to run regularly and build statistics on if internet is down and what kind of speed user has.

Enjoy!
